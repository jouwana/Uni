included are algorithms for the Map problem.

includes:
distnace hueristic, time hueristic, real time (traffic included) vs expected time heuristics.

uses BFS search, unoform cost, Astar and Astar epsilon algorithms to search for best road, based on the different hueristics sent to the algorithm

full project in Zipped folder.

separated are the algorithms for Astar and Astar epsilon
