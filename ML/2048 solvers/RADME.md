different algorithms to solve 2048 games

* basic Greedy

* Improved Greedy

* minimax move and index players

* alpha-beta minimax player

* expectimax move and index players

the first four algorithms assume that only tile value 2 can be added to the game.

expectimax can add tile 2 and 4 to the game, with a probablity of 0.9 ofr 2 and 0.1 for 4
